# Recommender-Engines-using-Spark-ALS
This project demonstrates how to build a Recommender Engine for recommending musical instrument purchases using Spark

The recommender engine is built using the inbuilt **"Alternating Least Squares (ALS)"** algorithm offered by Spark

The data for this has been taken from actual Amazon reviews. It can be downloaded from the below link:

http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html

You can just replace the datasets with any of the review datasets available like appliances, books, software etc. and it will return the corresponding recommendations

You need to download both these datasets:
1) Reviews data
2) Meta data (has the product descriptions)
